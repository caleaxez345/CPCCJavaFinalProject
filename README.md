# CPCCJavaFinalProject
 This was the final project for my Java CSC-151 class at CPCC.

 This projected created a Computer Hardware Recommendation Project which would get input on your amount of computers being processed, clock speed for graphics card, clock speed for processor, number of cores, and resolution. While you input this information the program will also verify the input and if it's not within the appropriate input range then the current option will be printed back and it'll loop until you enter a valid input.
 Once you enter the valid input for everything then you'll get everything printed back out to you and it'll also display the calculated recommended graphics quality, highest and lowest performance score on the computers you entered. This program calculates this information by using the Hardware class to get the necessary calculations.
